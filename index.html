The software contains about 5,500 problems covering computation problems (equations), word problems (various types including multi-step problems), and number space problems. The adaptive algorithm calculated individual solution probabilities for each problem class and selected problems to regulate cognitive load to moderate levels, ensuring skills were neither too easy (autonomous phase) nor too difficult (cognitive phase requiring close supervision).",
        implementation: "Students practiced with the software for seven 45-minute sessions over eight weeks (including one vacation week) in school computer labs.

Students were first asked to complete circuit assignments using the semi-realistic simulation that visualized current flow and allowed easy manipulation of circuit components. After successfully completing each assignment in the simulation, they immediately repeated the same assignment with real laboratory equipment located next to the computer. This approach was designed to help students first discover theoretical principles through the idealized simulation environment, then transfer and verify that these laws apply in real-world circuits, promoting conceptual change by bridging theory and reality.",

After a 15-minute general introduction to electricity (identical across all conditions), student pairs worked through 12 worksheets with progressively challenging circuit assignments. In the combination condition, each worksheet was completed first with the simulation, then verified with physical equipment. Worksheets contained instructional questions encouraging attention to circuit configurations and their effects on bulb brightness and voltages. Teachers controlled progression, checking answers before students could advance to the next worksheet.",

                    Although remote learning models have existed for decades, their relevance surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted widespread school closures and shifted millions of students into online learning environments. This disruption highlighted the urgent need to understand which forms of remote instructional approaches are effective—and for whom.

                    Despite the rapid adoption of remote learning tools, education leaders continue to face a lack of clear, evidence-based guidance on the effectiveness of math and science programs. Existing reviews have largely overlooked these subject areas and rarely explore how program effectiveness varies by student characteristics, program features, or contextual factors.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    This meta-analysis addresses these gaps by synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remote learning interventions in PreK–12 math and science education. The goal is to generate actionable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions and identify the conditions under which they are most successful.
