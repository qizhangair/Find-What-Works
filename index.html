                      Standalone digital learning programs—web-based tools and applications that students can use independently without extensive instructor guidance—have become increasingly important in PreK-12 education, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic when school closures affected over 55 million U.S. students. While existing research shows promise for technology-enhanced instruction, prior reviews have been narrow in focus and have not systematically examined which program features, student characteristics, and implementation contexts lead to the best outcomes.

                      This meta-analysis synthesizes evidence from randomized controlled trials to answer three key questions: (1) What are the average effects of standalone digital learning programs on PreK-12 student achievement in math and science? (2) Do effects vary by program characteristics, such as delivery format, instructional approach, and personalization features? (3) Do effects vary by student and setting characteristics, including grade level, geographic region, and school context?

                      We conducted a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of 68 randomized controlled trials (147 effect sizes) published between 2007 and 2022. Studies were included if they evaluated standalone digital programs in math or science with PreK-12 students and reported quantitative achievement outcomes. We used robust variance estimation meta-regression to synthesize effect sizes and test moderators related to program design, implementation, and context. Our analysis revealed an overall moderate positive effect (g = 0.44), with substantial variation explained by factors such as delivery timing, instructional approach, personalization features, grade level, and country income level.
