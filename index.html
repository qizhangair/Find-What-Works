It provides step-by-step guidance while students solve problems, gives immediate feedback when errors occur, and adapts instruction based on each student's responses. The system is designed to mirror one-on-one tutoring by prompting students through problem-solving steps rather than simply giving answers.",
        howItWasUsed: "Students used the tutoring software during regular math class time as part of their algebra instruction.

Students received approximately two hours per day of live satellite instruction, integrated into the regular school schedule, with instruction adjusted over time to better match student ability levels.",

                    Although remote learning models have existed for decades, their relevance surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted widespread school closures and shifted millions of students into online learning environments. This disruption highlighted the urgent need to understand which forms of remote instructional approaches are effective—and for whom.

                  <p>
                    Despite the rapid adoption of remote learning tools, education leaders continue to face a lack of clear, evidence-based guidance on the effectiveness of math and science programs. Existing reviews have largely overlooked these subject areas and rarely explore how program effectiveness varies by student characteristics, program features, or contextual factors.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    This meta-analysis addresses these gaps by synthesizing findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of remote learning interventions in PreK–12 math and science education. The goal is to generate actionable insights into the effectiveness of these interventions and identify the conditions under which they are most successful.
